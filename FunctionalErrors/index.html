      <h1>Summary: </h1>
      <p>Creative Coding in practical form and in “critical engagement with digital media has become a part of the art education curriculum” (1) in recent years, providing new material approaches to practice-based teaching. This newer material approach to technology provides important potential for creative expression and pathways within creative industries for experiential approaches. However, there still remains a friction between materials used for solution driven outputs and how they can be used in experimental forms.
      </p>
      <p>When transitioning from a predominantly screen-based exploration of creative code to electronic physical components, beginners are faced with three areas to troubleshoot; the software, the hardware, and the bridging of the two together. This research seeks to question how the bridge between software and hardware can be communicated more effectively for students in an Art School environment and if in doing so, what are the educational benefits of exploring these functional errors for staff and students?</p>
      <p>The term functional error exists within Computer Science as the handling of errors in programmable functions or if an expected function negatively impacts the behaviour of the software. However, this research seeks to establish a definition of functional error as a piece of code that compiles without error in software yet in the physical environment, it results in a kinetic or visual error. This type of error is often the result of a disconnect between what a microcontroller can achieve and what a human eye or mechanical component can enact. It can also be the result of a conceptual misunderstanding as to what the software may enact as a visual output.</p>
<p>When discussing the bridge between software and hardware the term bridge is defined in two parts. The first, a physical communication protocol between code (software) and an electronic circuit (hardware). The second, as the conceptual space that joins these elements. The bridge is often only made tangible via a cable joining software and hardware together and as such it can become difficult to troubleshoot from a conceptual and practical perspective.</p>

      <h1>Questions : </h1>
      <ul>
        <li>How can the bridge between software and hardware be communicated more effectively for students and staff in an Art School environment and if in doing so, what are the educational benefits of exploring these functional errors for staff and students?</li>
        <li>If a greater understanding of electronic circuits and code can be obtained by not necessarily solving or removing friction points but by primarily only highlighting them, and in doing so can physical computing materials provide more expressive creative freedom when these barriers to learning are removed?</li>
        <li>How does the use of embodied interaction, via familiar Art School materials, inform our computational understanding?</li>

      <h1>Aims and Objectives : </h1>
      <ul>
        <li>To demonstrate how the role of certain programming methods (such as timing) can affect the behavior of an output using augmented pedagogical approaches from Art School practices.</li>
        <li>To re-contextualise existing screen-based programming methods into physical materials to see if Art School staff and students can more easily comprehend such methods.</li>
      <li>To articulate in practical forms common pain points when bridging software with hardware to provide Art School staff and students with more creative agency in the long term.</li>
      </ul>

    <h1>Bridge Prototype #01 (Explore) : </h1>

    <p>The iterative process of a capacitive grid controller. </p>
    <p>The role of Bridge Prototype 01 is to be used as an explorative device in understanding the relationship between chnaging certain variables such as timing.</p>
