      <h1>Intro : </h1>
      <p>A month long residency throughout November 2020 in association with the Geothe Institute</p>
      <p>A humanoid NAO robot toured several cities across Europe and was taught a new skill at each city. This page
        documents its experience in Glasgow residency the new skills it learnt. </p>
      <br>
      <h2>Concept: </h2>
      <p>Throughout this residency we wanted to reflect on the negative way in which robots are portrayed in popular
        culture. Often it is
        considered in a “zero sum game” sort of way where robots are either thought of as a threat to jobs, or
        considered as functional objects replacing humans in mundane repetitive work. Both of these are considerations
        of an ableist capitalist reality where value is measured through productivity levels. On top of that while
        humanoid robots are seen as separate “species”, they are not because their production doesn’t happen in
        isolation of any human input. We aimed to examine these assumptions by teaching the NAO skills that relfect on a
        softer appoach to empowerment. </p>
      <br>
      <h2>Tracking: </h2>
      <p>Our first instincts were to try and use existing Machine Learning models to automate a tracking of different
        dance poses.
        We would then break these poses down and translate this information to NAO. We used <a
          href="https://runwayml.com/">Runway ML</a> and the Open PifPaf model to analyse dance videos and generate
        tracked poses. </a></p>

            <div class="grid-item"><img src="openPose.gif" width="401" height="300"></div>
            <div class="grid-item"><img src="poseNet.gif" width="401" height="300"></div>
           
  
          </div>
      <p>Each joint could be tracked and visualised with a colourful dot. The intention being the NAO could track the
        moving dot using its 'Red Ball Tracker' object to translate the movement into it's own joint</p>
        <div id="frames">
          <section>
            <div class="grid-container">
              <div class="grid-item"><img src="tracking.jpg" width="800" height="450"></div>
    
            </div>
      <p>We discovered the more fluid mapping of one movement to another was problematic for the NAO in the Chroeographe
        Software where its building block style coding environment was more suited to colour tracking working with
        distinct outputs such as on/off type triggers. </p>
      <p>With this in mind we approach the tracking from a human perspective, using the generated videos to help us
        break down each dance pose in more detail to then pass this information on to the NAO.</p>
      <p><i>---->Image of us teaching ourselves poses?</i></p>
      <br>
      <h2>Autonomous: </h2>
      <p>We adapted our teaching approach to use the Animation Timeline and Autonomouse Mode with the NAO. This provided
        us with the a more flexible, fluid mode of teaching the poses.
        By manualling moving each joint into position we could act as the translator between our own knowledge and the
        NAO's understanding.
      </p>
      <p><i>Image of us teaching NAO poses</i></p>
      <p>It was interesting for us to note how our own dissemination of the information had to change in order to
        translate it to the NAO.
        We took on a role of 'thinking like a computer' in order to breakdown each pose in a way the NAO could interpet
        effectively. Certain movements we thought possible had to be revised due to the NAO's join limitations.

      <h2>Pronouns: </h2>
      <p>Often within computing any identification processes have potential to come with bias either from the sources of
        identification they have been trained on or via programmers providing such data. </p>
      <p>The pre-existing building blocks with Choreograph point towards some of these problematic areas with Gender
        Identifying and Facial Recognition code blocks. We reflected on this bystaging our own speech recognition
        process. In <i>"having a conversation" </i>"with the NAO we wim to demonstrate the flexibility a robot can have
        in learning new protocols such as affirming people's pronouns.
        Which humans can find more difficult to adjust to. </p>

      <h2>Voguing: </h2>
      <p>Voguing stems from the danceform developed within the Black, Latinx and Gay Ballroom Scene of Harlem/New York
        (its roots can be traced back to Harlem’s drag ballroom competitions as early as the 1920s. it is important to
        us to acknowledge and pay respect to the origins of this style and use the opportunity we got to uplift it.
        Developed by people who were denied access to aspects of sexist and capitalist mainstream society because of the
        intersection of gender identity and race. It orginated as means to taking up space, showing up and demonstrating skill, power
        sophistication and wit in a non oppressive way.

        Ballroom competitions created an inclusive space for empowerment, belonging and creative and subjective
        expression which we were keen for NAO to model and point to by teaching it this style.

      <p>As the residency progressed we used the methods mentioned above to teach the NAO a Vogue sequence. The video below demonstrates the complete sequnce.</p>
